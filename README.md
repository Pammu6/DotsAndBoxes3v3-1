# DotsAndBoxes3v3
We have implemented a 3 player version of the Dots and Boxes game. This game starts with an empty grid of dots. In this implementation 3 players take turns to add a single horizontal or vertical line in the grid, between two dots which are already not joined. Any player who completes the fourth side of the box earns one point and then takes another turn. This game will end when there are no more lines which can be placed in the grid and the player with maximum points wins the game.
